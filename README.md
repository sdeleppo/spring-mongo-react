## Overview
Within this repo is a full-stack web app Contact Manager utilizing React, Springboot, & MongoDB completed for my capstone project. The purpose of the project was to take code I wrote previously and enhance it in some way. I chose to take a backend contact management service I had written in Java (found in folder `original_code` in this repo) and turn it into a full-stack application utilizing React for the frontend, Springboot, & MongoDB.

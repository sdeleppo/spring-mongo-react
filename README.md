## Overview
This is a full-stack web application which allows users to store, update, manage, and search their contacts utilizing RESTful API. The backend was developed using Java and Spring, the frontend was developed using React, Axios, and JavaScript. This project also utilizes a MongoDB database to house contact data.

The purpose of the project was to take code I wrote previously and enhance it in some way. I chose to take a backend contact management service I had written in Java (found in folder `original_code` in this repo) and turn it into a full-stack application utilizing React for the frontend, Springboot, & MongoDB.
